# Workspace
An initializer script to create a new workspace, so that I don't have to manually install everything I want/need.

### Footnote
The initializer script is yet to be completed; this is because my "workspace" consists of a variety of tools that I variate between, and as everything is subject to change it's hard to pin down everything I want in my installation script.
However, I believe it will grow with time.
